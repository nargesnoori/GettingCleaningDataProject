This is the final project for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, delivers the following:

* Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
* Load the activity and feature 
* Loads the training and test datasets, and keeps only the columns which show a mean or standard deviation
* Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset
* Merges the relative columns with the dataset
* Merges the two datasets
* Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
* Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
